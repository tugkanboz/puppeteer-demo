# puppeteer-demo
This project uses Puppeteer and Cucumber to write and run acceptance tests. It generates an HTML report of the test results, which is then deployed to GitHub Pages for easy sharing. 
 
## Run tests
"npm test" runs the "cucumber-js" command, which is a command-line interface for running Cucumber tests. The "-f json:public/cucumber_report.json" flag specifies that the results of the tests should be output in JSON format and saved to the "public/cucumber_report.json" file.
```
npm test
```

## Generate reports
"npm run generatereport" runs the "node" command, which is used to run JavaScript scripts. It runs the "public/report.js" script, which likely generates the HTML report using the JSON file generated by the "npm test" script.
```
npm run generatereport
```
